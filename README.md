# Slides — Your Open Source Standard Is Just Another Lock-In

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # live preview with presenter notes (press `o` / open ?presenter)
npm run export   # PDF (needs `npm i -D playwright-chromium` once)
```

Project logos in `public/logos/` come from [cncf/artwork](https://github.com/cncf/artwork).
Kubernetes and OpenTelemetry ship colour marks. The OpenFeature mark is monochrome, so
`ProjectLogo.vue` uses the white SVG as a CSS mask filled with `currentColor` — it picks up
the slide's ink colour and needs no separate black/white file per theme.

Speaker notes (the dialog cues) are in the HTML comments under each slide and show up in Slidev's presenter view.
Search for `TODO` in `slides.md` for the exhibits that still need real material.

## Hosting

Pushes to `main` build the deck and publish it to GitHub Pages via
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` → https://aepfli.github.io/open-standard-vendor-lock-in/
